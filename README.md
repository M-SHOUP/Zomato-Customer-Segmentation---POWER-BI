Demographic Dashboard: Visualized key customer attributes including age, gender, occupation, education, income tier, marital status, and household size.

Segmented Personas: Cross-referenced attributes (e.g., age and income, family size and occupation) to identify dominant user segments.

Ordering Behavior: Tracked purchase frequency, order values (average and median), and seasonal trends to understand how different segments engage with the platform.
